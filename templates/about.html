        <h1>About</h1>
      
        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>We've been hearing from our biker friends about the frequent incidents of bike theft. In response, we've taken proactive measures to support and protect our biking community.</p>
        <h2>What it does</h2>
          <p>We developed a website that identifies the closest dock relative to the user's location.</p>
        <h2>How we built it</h2>
          <p>To construct our platform, we utilized HTML/CSS for website development and MongoDB for database management. Flask served as our web server, enabling database access. Neurelo facilitated database interaction through APIs.</p>
        <h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>
          <p>Our primary challenge was that we all just learned these technologies over the weekend. Getting started was especially challenging, particularly with MongoDB, as it was our first time working with a database. Setting up Flask and pymongo required a lot of installation, adding to the complexity. Linking files in Flask was also tough, as navigating the correct paths proved to be quite tricky. Additionally, when we tried to work with Neurelo, our initial knowledge was limited. Despite this, we needed to utilize Neurelo to generate APIs for retrieving data from the database.</p>
        <h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>
          <p>It is our first time to really work this We're proud to have learned everything in such a short time frame, allowing us to successfully build the website, set up the database, and create the necessary APIs. </p>
        <h2>What we learned</h2>
          <p>We learned to use MongoDB for database management and connected HTML to Flask to enable database interaction. We also gained valuable experience in utilizing APIs to improve program functionality.</p>
        <h2>What's next for ParkSF</h2>
          <p>For the next stage, we will have the user to access their travel history. They can save or add star to their favorite paths in their user portal.</p>
